    "When the current is constant, $B_{1}$ is constant in time and the electric field and magnetic fields **outside** the solenoid will be *essentially* **zero**. When the current is varied, however, there is a **curly electric field** both outside and inside the solenoid. Note that the magnetic field still does not exist outside of the solenoid with a varying current, as shown in **Figure 1**.\n",

    "**<center> Figure 1. A current varying over time in a solenoid produces a curly electric field.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Inside the solenoid, the electric field is *proportional* to r (distance from the axis). This means that as the point of interest nears the axis (decreasing r), the electric field is also decreasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside the solenoid, the curly electric field is proportional to $\\frac{1}{r}$. In contrast with the inside electric field, the curly electric field on the outside gets smaller as the point of interest moves away from the solenoid.\n",

    "**<u>Right-hand rule** Point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the rate of change of the magnetic field ($\\frac{-d\\vec{B_{1}}}{dt}$) and curl fingers toward your palm. The direction in which the tip of the fingers are pointing is the direction of the curly electric field. \n",
    "    \n",
    "To find the direction of the rate of change of the magnetic field, change $\\frac{-d\\vec{B_{1}}}{dt}$ to $\\frac{-\\Delta \\vec{B_{1}}}{\\Delta t}$, where $\\Delta t$ is a small, finite time interval. Then, the direction of $\\frac{-\\Delta \\vec{B_{1}}}{\\Delta t}$ = the direction of $-\\Delta \\vec{B_{1}}$.\n",

    "A solenoid with a ring over it will produce a current in the ring. The resulting $\\vec{E_{NC}}$ will be in the same direction, as shown in **Figure 3**. Relate this to a battery, wire, and current.\n",
